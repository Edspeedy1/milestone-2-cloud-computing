What's the different of Source and Sink connectors?

I think this is supposed to say "..the difference between Source.."
and the difference would be what is being done with the data (duh)
but in other words, sources are the source of the data and sinks
collect the data, gemini likes to explain it as the in-box and 
out-box of a data pipeline and I like that analogy. The source
connector in the design section is collecting data from my python
script when it pushes data to the pub sub, and the sink would be\
my other python script that collects the data, or the mysql 
database that is collecting these pub sub messages



What's the applications of the connectors?

connectors (like their names imply) let you connect different apps
together and feed data from one thing to another. Gemini is telling 
me that its like the glue that holds apps together, but I don't 
like this analogy as much as the other one. I think connectors are
more like the roads that data can be traveling on and they let us
easily connect my python script into a database and then connect to
another script and send data every which way, without worrying about
the underlying systems at play (like an abstraction layer). The 
application of connectors is flow in this design pattern, how data 
gets from one place to another:
- sources making data, detecting changes, messages, etc.
- hubs buffering that data and storing it for later (databases)
- sinks getting the data that they need and doing things with it
